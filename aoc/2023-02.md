This is a solution of the [day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2). Go back to year [2023](/aoc/2023). Go back to [AOC](/aoc/).

## main.py

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

prefix = "Game "
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
limits = [12, 14, 13]
first_sum = 0
second_sum = 0

def under_limits(counters, limits):
  for i in range(len(counters)):
    if limits[i] < counters[i]:
      return False
  return True

with open('INPUT') as f:
  for line in f:
    counters =[0 for _ in colors]
    game = line[:-1].split(": ")
    nr_game = int(game[0][len(prefix):])
    sep = [draw.split(", ") for draw in game[1].split("; ")]
    nr_co = [[y.split(" ") for y in x] for x in sep]
    for i in range(len(nr_co)):
      for j in range(len(nr_co[i])):
        nr_co[i][j][0] = int(nr_co[i][j][0])
        counters[colors.index(nr_co[i][j][1])] = max(nr_co[i][j][0], counters[colors.index(nr_co[i][j][1])])
    if under_limits(counters, limits):
      first_sum += nr_game
    second_sum += counters[0] * counters[1] * counters[2]

print(f"First part: {first_sum}")
print(f"Second part: {second_sum}")
```
