This is a solution of the day 04.


# main.py

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

total_sum = 0
overlap_sum = 0

with open("INPUT") as f:
  for line in f:
    if line != '\n':
      comp = line.split(",")
      first = comp[0].split("-")
      second = comp[1].split("-")
      diff1 = int(first[0]) - int(second[0])
      diff2 = int(first[1]) - int(second[1])
      overlap1 = int(first[1]) - int(second[0])
      overlap2 = int(first[0]) - int(second[1])
      if (diff1 <= 0 and diff2 >= 0) or (diff1 >= 0 and diff2 <= 0):
        total_sum += 1
      if (overlap1 == 0 or overlap2 == 0) or (overlap1 > 0 and overlap2 < 0) or (overlap1 < 0 and overlap2 > 0):
        overlap_sum += 1

print(f"Prvni: {total_sum}")
print(f"Druhy: {overlap_sum}")
```
