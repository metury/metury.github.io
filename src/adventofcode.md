# Advent of code

They are my solutions to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) tasks. There are separated to each year and day. All of this can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/metury/advent-of-code), also with the script that generates these pages.
Plus you may also play a small [Bingo](https://aoc-bingo.fly.dev/) that someone made. Also you may consider joining [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) where you may find useful tips, or help someone.
