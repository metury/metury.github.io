# Programming languages

Every time when someone is creating a new software project there is the question one will ask sooner or later. That is which programming language am I going to use. So I decided to at least put some links for some languages I have tried for later purposes.

## Object oriented languages

These are the commonly used languages which have objects as their main object.

### C++

### [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

- [Crates - libraries](https://crates.io/)

### [Go](https://go.dev/)

- [Libraries](https://pkg.go.dev/)

### [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

## Functional languages

Functional programming is not that popular, but trust me it is really fun.

### [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

- [Libraries](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/)

## Scripting languages

For some small programs it is better to use just scripts.
