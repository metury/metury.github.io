# Introduction

We will be working in $d$-dimensional space (noted as $\mathbb{R}^d$) which is a set of all ordered $d$-tuples of reals.

## Definition:

**Hyperplane** (*nadrovina*) is:

$$
\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d:\langle a,x \rangle = b \}, b \in \mathbb{R}, a \in \mathbb{R}^d \setminus \{\mathcal{o}\}

$$

$$
\langle a,x \rangle := a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} + \dots a_{d}x_{d}

$$

Which are the coordinates of $a$ and $x$. Also $\mathcal{o}$ is marked as the beginning (*počátek*).

## Definition:

**Closed half-space** (*uzavřený poloprostor*).

$$
\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d : \langle a,x \rangle \leq b\}

$$

# Convexity

## Definition:

$C \subseteq \mathcal{R}^d, C$ is **convex**: $x,y \in C \Rightarrow \text{ segment xy } \subseteq C$. Or you may say:

$$
tx + (1-t)y \in C, \forall t \in [0,1]

$$

### Observation

The intersection of any set of convex sets is a convex set.

#### Proof:

We get this from the definition.

$$
\Box

$$

## Definition:

$\text{conv}(X)$ is a **convex hull** of $X$ (*konvexní obal*) is the intersection of all convex sets containing $X$.

### Claim:

$$
x \in \text{conv}(X) \Leftrightarrow \exists x_{1}, \dots x_{n} \in X, \exists t_{1}, \dots, t_{n} \in \mathbb{R}, t_{i} \geq 0, \sum_{i}^{n} t_{i} = 1: x= \sum_{i=1}^{n}t_{i}x_{i}

$$

That means the $x$ is a convex combination of the points $x_{i}$.

#### Proof

$$
Y := \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}x_{i} : x_{1}, \dots, x_{n} \in X, t_{i} \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i} = 1 \right\}

$$

- Now we will be proving that $Y = \text{conv}(X)$. Firstly we will start with $Y \subseteq \text{conv}(X)$ by proving that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}x_{i} \in \text{conv}(X)$. We will do it by induction by $n$.
- For $n=1$ and $n=2$ we know this from definition. Then $x := \sum t_{i} x_{i}$ and *wlog* (without loss of generality) $t_{1} > 0$. Then we have $x = t_{1}x_{1} + (1 - t_{1}) \sum_{i=2}^{n} \frac{t_{i}}{1-t_{1}}x_{1}$ which shows by induction that $x$ is in $\text{conv}(X)$, because $x_{1}$ is in convex hull and the second one is by induction in convex hull as well and then we have convex combination of two points.
- Secondly we need to show that $\text{conv}(X) \subseteq Y$ but this suffices to prove $Y \supseteq X$ and that $Y$ is convex. First part we get by the definition of $Y$.
- Now we need to show convexity of $Y$. So we have two points $x = \sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}x_{i}$ and $x' = \sum_{i=1}^{n} t'_{i}x_{i}$. The combination is as follows:

$$
tx + (1-t)x' = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( tt_{i} + (1-t)t'\right) x_{i}

$$

- We can easily see that $Y$ is convex and then we get $\text{conv}(X) \subseteq Y$ thus we know $Y = \text{conv}(X)$.

$$
\Box

$$

## Carrathéodory theorem

Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}, x \in \text{conv}(X)$. Then $x$ is a convex combination of $\leq d+1$ points of $X$.

### Proof

Will be on tutorial. ==Maybe I will add it in here.==

$$
\Box

$$

## Separation theorem *(věta o oddělování nadrovinou)*

$C, D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ convex and $C \cap D = \emptyset$. Then exist a hyperplane such that $C$ lies in one of the closed halfspaces and $D$ in the other one. *Alternatively:*

$$
\exists a \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus \{o\}, b \in \mathbb{R}: \left<a,x\right> \leq b \forall x \in C \\
\exists a \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus \{o\}, b \in \mathbb{R}: \left<a,x\right> \geq b \forall x \in D

$$

### Remark 1

This is not true for open halfspaces.

### Remark 2

True for open halfspaces provided that $C$ is closed and $D$ is compact.

### Sketch of proof

#### case 1

$C$ is closed and $D$ is compact then exists $p \in C$ and $q \in D$ such that the distance is minimal. Then we put the hyperplane perpendicular to the segment $pq$ in the middle. Then it is separated strictly. If it was false there would exist $p'$ which is closer to $q$ than $p$ which cannot be.

#### case 2

$C,D$ arbitrary and $u \in C, v \in D$ arbitrary . For $n \in \mathbb{N}: C_{n} := (1- \frac{1}{n})(C - u) + u$ and $D_{n} := (1- \frac{1}{n})(D - v) + v$. *Note this is shrinking the set around the center in $u$ or $v$*. Then we define $D_{n}' = D_{n} \cap B(v,n)$ where $B$ is ball with big radius. Then $\forall n D \supseteq \overline{D_{n}'}$ and $\overline{D_{n}'}$ is compact and the closure of $D_{n}'$. Same for $C$ we have $C \supseteq \overline{C_{n}}$ and this is closed. Both $\overline{D_{n}'}$ and $\overline{C_{n}'}$ can be separated by a hyperplane $h/n$ due to case 1.

$$
h/n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d} : \left< a_{n}, x\right> = b_{n}\}

$$

# Affine subspaces, affine dependence

## Affine subspace

This is linear subspace shifted by some vector.

## Affine hull

of a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d} = \text{aff}(X)$ is the smallest affine subspace containing $X$.

## Affine combination

of points $a_{1}, \dots, a_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \alpha_{i} a_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \\
\forall i : \alpha_{i} \in \mathbb{R}, \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i} = 1

$$

### Claim

$\text{aff}(X)$ is the set of all affine combinations of points from $X$.

## Definition

$a_{1}, \dots, a_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ are **affine dependent** if $\exist k:a_{k}$ is an affine combination of $a_{1}, \dots, a_{k-1}, a_{k+1}, \dots, a_{n}$.

$$
\Updownarrow

$$

$\exist \alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_{n} \in \mathbb{R}: \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i}a_{i} = 0$ if $(\alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_{n}) \neq (0, \dots, 0)$ and $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \alpha_{i} = 0$

Otherwise $a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}$ are **affine dependent**.

### Observation

1.  $a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}$ are affine dependent iff $a_{2}-a_{1}, a_{3} - a_{1}, \dots, a_{n}-a_{1}$ are linear independent. ==Maybe this should be both independent or dependent.==
2.  Max number of affine independent points in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is $d+1$.
3.  Affine hull of $k$ affine independent points has dimension $k-1$.

## Radon’s theorem

$A$ is a set od $d+2$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ then $\exist A_{1}, A_{2} \subseteq A : A_{1} \cap A_{2} = \emptyset$ and $\text{conv}(A_{1}) \cap \text{conv}(A_{2}) \neq \emptyset$.

### Proof

- $A = \{a_{1}, \dots, a_{d+2}\}$ are affine dependents points.
- There $\exist (\alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_{d+2}) \neq (0, \dots, 0), \sum_{i = 1}^{d+2} \alpha_{i} = 0$ and also $\sum_{i= 1}^{d+2}\alpha_{i} a_{i} = 0$.
- Then we put $A_{1} = \{a_{i} : \alpha_{i} > 0\} \neq \emptyset$ and $A_{2} = \{a_{i} : \alpha_{i} < 0\} \neq \emptyset$.
- $A_{1} \ni \sum_{\alpha_{i}>0} a_{i} = \sum_{\alpha_{i} < 0} ( - \alpha_{i})a_{i} \in A_{2}$
- $S := \sum_{\alpha_{i}} \alpha_{i} = \sum_{\alpha_{i} < 0} \alpha_{i}$. And together we have.

$$
x = \sum_{\alpha_{i} > 0} \left(\frac{\alpha_{i}}{S}\right)a_{i} = \sum_{\alpha_{i} < 0} \left(\frac{-\alpha_{i}}{S}\right)a_{i}

$$

- So we have that $x \in \text{conv}(A_{1}) \land x \in \text{conv}(A_{2})$. And $x$ is called *Radon’s point*.

$$
\Box

$$

## Helly’s theorem

$C_{1}, C_{2}, \dots ,C_{n}$ are convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ where $n \geq d+1$. The intersection of any $d+1$ sets $C_{i}$ be non-empty. Then $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} C_{i} \neq \emptyset$.

### Proof

We will proof this by induction on $n$ and $d$ is fixed.

1.  $n = d+1$ is obvious
2.  suppose $n \geq d+2$

$$
\forall j : \bigcap_{i \neq j} C_{i} \neq \emptyset \text{ , then fix any } a_{j} \in \bigcap_{i \neq j}C_{i}

$$

- We use Radon’s theorem for $a_{1}, \dots, a_{d+2}$ so there $\exist I_{1}, I_{2} \subseteq \{1,\dots,d+2\}$ disjoint sets such that the $x \in \text{conv}(\{a_{j} : j \in I_{1}\}) \cap \text{conv}(\{a_{j} : j \in I_{2}\}) \neq \emptyset$.

1.  $i \in \{1, \dots, n\} \setminus I_{1}$ then $\forall j \in I_{1}: a_{j} \in C_{i}, x\in C_{i}$.
2.  $i \in \{1, \dots, n\} \setminus I_{2}$ is with the same way so $x \in C_{i}$.

- So $x \in C_{i} \forall i$.

$$
\Box

$$

## Infinite version of Helly’s theorem

$C$ is an infinite set of convex compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that the intersection of any $d+1$ of them is non-empty. Then $\bigcap C \neq \emptyset$.

### Proof

By the finite Helly’s theorem the intersection of a finite collection of sets from $C$ is non-empty. By the compactness we get $\bigcap C \neq \emptyset$.

$$
\Box

$$

## Definition

Let $X$ be an $n$-point set in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then **centerpoint** of $X$ is any point $c \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that every closed half space containing $c$ contains at least $\frac{n}{d+1}$ points of $X$.

## Centerpoint theorem *(věta o centru)*

$\forall$ finite $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ $X$ has a centerpoint.

### Proof

- Firstly we will show an observation that $c$ is a centerpoint iff $c$ lies in each open half-space $\mu$ such that $| X \cap \mu | > \frac{d}{d+1} | X |$. Wich implies that the intersection of any $d+1$ such half-spaces contains at least 1 point of $X$.
- $C = \{ \text{conv}(X \cap \mu) : \mu \text{ open half-space, } | X \cap \mu | > \frac{d}{d+1} |X|\}$ which is a finite set of compact sets.
- Now we got that every $d+1$ sets of $C$ have a non-empty intersection.
- So we will apply Helly’s theorem and we get that $\bigcap C \neq \emptyset$.
- Thus any $c \in \bigcap C$ is a centerpoint of $X$.

$$
\Box

$$

## Definition

A hyperplane $h \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ **bisects** a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ if each open halfspace defined by $h$ contains $\leq \lfloor \frac{|A|}{2} \rfloor$ points of $A$.

## Ham-sandwich theorem

Every $d$ finite sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ can be simultaneously bisected by a hyperplane.

### Proof

*This is not trivial so we won’t be showing this proof.*

### Remark

There are recursions for probability measures.

## Center-Transversal theorem

$1 \leq k \leq d, A_{1}, \dots, A_{k}$ finite sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ implies $\exist (k-1)$ dimensional affine subspace $f$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that for every hyperplane $h$ containing $f$ each closed half-space defined by $H$ contains $\geq \frac{1}{d-k+2}|A_{i}|$ points of $A_{i}$ for every $i = 1, \dots, k$.

*Note: If $k=d$ then it is the Ham-Sandwich theorem. And if $k = 1$ it is the centerpoint theorem.*

### Proof

*This won’t be proved.*

# Incidence problems

## Szeméredi-Trotter theorem

$\forall m,n \geq 1$ the number of point-line incidences between $n$ points and $m$ lines in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is at most $O(m^{2/3} n^{2/3} + m + n)$. This bound is asymptotically tight.

For the proof we will need several definitions and lemmas.

## Definition

**Geometric graph** is $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is set of points in general position in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $E$ are straight line segments connecting (some) points of $V$.

## Definition

$\text{cr}(G)$ is **crossing number** *(průsečíkové číslo)* of $G$ and it is the number of pairs of crossing edges.

## Crossing lemma

For every geometric graph $G =(V,E)$ the crossing number is $\text{cr}(G) \geq \frac{1}{64} \frac{|E|^{3}}{|V|^{2}}$, but only if $|E| \geq 4 |V|$. This is asymptotically tight.

### Observation

$G=(V,E)$ is geometric graph, then $\text{cr}(G) \geq |E| - 3 |V|$.

#### Proof

Induction on $|E| - 3|V|$.

1.  $|E| - 3|V| \leq 0$ trivial
2.  $|E| - 3 |V| = k \geq 0$ then $G$ is non-planer which means there exist crossing and this implies that exist $e \in E$ participating in at least one crossing. So we define $G' = G - e$.

$$
|E'| - 3 |V| = k-1 \Rightarrow \text{cr}(G') \geq |E'| - 3 |V'| \\
\Downarrow \\
\text{cr}(G) \geq \text{cr}(G') + 1 \geq |E| - 3|V| \\
\Box

$$

### Proof of crossing lemma

- $G = (V,E)$ geometric graph.
- Let $p \in [0,1]$ to be fixed later.
- $G"$ is graph obtained from $G$ by removing each vertex with probability $(1-p)$ independently.
- $G' = (V',E')$
- $\mathbb{E}(|V'|) = |V| \cdot p$
- $\mathbb{E}(|E'|) = p^{2} \cdot |E|$
- $\mathbb{E}(\text{cr}(G')) = p^{4} \cdot \text{cr}(G)$ which are quite easy to see.
- $\text{cr}(G') \geq |E'| - 3|V'|$
- $\mathbb{E}(\text{cr}(G')) \geq \mathbb{E}(|E'|) - 3\mathbb{E}(|V'|)$
- $p^{4} \text{cr}(G) \geq p^{2}|E| - 3p|V|$
- $\text{cr}(G) \geq \frac{p|E| - e|V|}{p^{3}}$ and we put $p := \frac{4|V|}{|E|} \leq 1$
- $\text{cr}(G) \geq \frac{1}{64} \frac{|E|^{3}}{|V|^{2}}$

$$
\Box

$$

### Proof of Szeméredi-Trotter theorem

- Let $P$ be set of $m$ points and $L$ set of $n$ lines. We will construct geometric graph $G= (V,E)$ where $V = P$ and $E$ are segments connecting neighboring points along each line.
- WLOG every line contains at least 1 point. $|E| = (\text{\# point-line incidences}) - n$.
- Every two-line cross is at max 1 so $\text{cr}(G) \leq \binom{n}{2}$.
- Now we have two possibilities $(A) \ \text{cr}(G) \geq \frac{1}{64} \frac{|E|^{3}}{|V|^{2}}$ or $(B) \ |E| < 4 |V|$.

$$
\begin{array}{lc}
(A) & \binom{n}{2} \geq \text{cr}(G) \geq \frac{1}{64} \frac{|E|^{3}}{|V|^{2}} \\
 & \binom{n}{2} \geq \frac{1}{64} \frac{((\text{\# point-line incidences}) - n)^{3}}{m^{2}} \\
 & ((\text{\# point-line incidences}) - n)^{3} \leq m^{2} 64 \binom{n}{2} \\
 & (\text{\# point-line incidences}) \leq (32 m^{2} n^{2})^{1/3} + n \\
 & \text{Done} \\
 (B) & (\text{\# point-line incidences}) - n < 4m \\
 & (\text{\# point-line incidences}) < 4m +n \\
 & \text{Done}
\end{array} \\
\Box

$$

### Remark

Crossing lemma holds also for graphs drawn by curves (or so called topological graphs).

### Lower bound in Szeméredi-Trotter theorem

There exists many constructions. For example where $n \approx m$. We will build $\sqrt{m} \times \sqrt{m}$ grid and then connect all the lines with the largest number of points.

### Remark

The crossing lemma can be also used to prove following theorem.

## Theorem

$n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ there exists $O(n^{4/3})$ unit *(length 1)* segments determined by pairs of these points.

### Idea of proof

We will construct *unit circles* around points which will construct topological graph.

## Minkowsky theorem

$C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ symmetric around $o$ which means $( C = -C)$ and is convex and bounded. $\text{vol}(C) > 2^{d}$. Then $C$ contains at least 1 lattice point different from $o$.

### Proof

- Let $C' = \frac{1}{2}C$ and $\text{vol}(C') > 1$.
- Then we have this claim: $\exist v \in \mathbb{Z}^{d} \setminus \{o\}$ such that $C' \cap (C'+v) \neq \emptyset$.
    - Proof of claim: $R > 0$ integer.

$$
X = \{C' + v : v \in [-R,R]^{d} \cap \mathbb{Z}^{d}\} \\
\bigcup X \subseteq K := [-R -D, R +D]^{d} \\
\text{where } D \text{ is diameter of C'} \\
\text{vol}(K) = (2R+2D)^{d} \\
\text{vol}(K) \geq |X| \text{vol}(C') \text{ or two bodies in } X \text{ intersect} \\
\text{vol}(C') \leq \left(1 + \frac{2D - 1}{2R - 1} \right)^{d} \to 1 \text{ as } R \to \infty \\
|X| = (2R+1)^{d} \\
\text{vol}(C') > 1 \\
\Box

$$

- $x \in C' \cap (C' + v)$, $x - v \in C' \Rightarrow v - x \in C'$, $C'$ is convex $\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}(v-x) \in C'$, $\frac{1}{2}v \in C' \Rightarrow v \in C$

$$
\Box

$$

# Applications

## Forest

Looking out of a regular forest (in each lattice point which is not origin we plant a tree with a radius $\epsilon > 0$).

## Fractions

Approximation an irrational number by a fraction $\alpha \in (0,1)$ real number. $N \in \mathbb{N}$ Then $\exist m,n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \leq N$ and

$$
\left| \alpha - \frac{m}{n} \right| < \frac{1}{nN} \leq \left( \frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)

$$

### Remark

It follows $\forall \alpha \in (0,1) \exist$ infinetely many pairs $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\left| \alpha - \frac{m}{n} \right| < \frac{1}{n^{2}}$.

==The proof was omitted.==

## General lattice

$z_{1}, \dots, z_{d}$ $d$ linear independent in $|mathbb{R}^{d}$ lattice with basis $\{z_{1}, \dots, z_{d}\}$.

$$
\Lambda = \Lambda (z_{1}, \dots, z_{n}) := \{i_{1}z_{1} + i_{2}z_{2} + \dots + i_{d}z_{d}: (i_{1}, \dots, i_{d}) \in \mathbb{Z}^{d}\}

$$

## Theorem (*Minkowski’s theorem for general lattices*)

$\Lambda$ is general lattice in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, $C$ is symmetric convex set with $\text{vol}(C) > 2^{d} \det(\Lambda)$. Then $C$ contains a point of $\Lambda$ differeent from $o$. Where

$$
\det(\Lambda) = \det
\begin{pmatrix}
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
z_{1} & z_{2} & \dots & z_{d} \\
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
\end{pmatrix}

$$

### Idea of proof

Simply apply Minkowski theorem.

## Primes

Each prime $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$ cam be written as $p = a^{2} + b^{2}, a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Geometric duality

## Definition

Geometric duality transform

$$
a \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus \{o\} : D_{o}(a) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d} : \left< a, x\right> = 1\} \\
h = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d} : \left< a, x \right> = 1\} : D_{o}(h) = a \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus \{o\}

h^{-} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}: \left<a, x\right> \leq 1\}

$$

## Lemma

$\forall$ point $p \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ , hyperplane $h \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$.

1.  $p \in h \Leftrightarrow D_{o}(h) \in D_{o}(p)$
2.  $p \in h^{-} \Leftrightarrow D_{o}(h) \in D_{o}(p)^{-}$

### Proof

1.  $p \in h \Leftrightarrow \left< a, p \right> = 1$ and $D_{o}(h) = a$, $D_{o}(p) = \{a \in \mathbb{R}^{d}: \left< y, p \right> = 1\} \Leftrightarrow D_{0}(h) \in D_{o}(p)$
2.  $p \in h^{-} \Leftrightarrow \left< a, p \right> \leq 1$ and $D_{o}(h) = a$, $D_{o}(p)^{-} = \{a \in \mathbb{R}^{d}: \left< y, p \right> = 1\} \Leftrightarrow D_{0}(h) \in D_{o}(p)^{-}$

$$
\Box

$$

## Definition

$$
X^{\ast} := \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{d} : \left< x, y \right> \leq 1, \forall x \in X\}

$$

- **$H$-polytope** is bounded $H$-polyhedron.
- **$V$-polytope** is the convex hull of a finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$.

- **cross polytope**: $\text{conv} \{e_{1}, -e_{1}, \dots, e_{d}, -e_{d}\}$
- **simplex**: the convex hull of affinly independent point set in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$.

## Definition

D(h) = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{d}) = a \ D(a) = h

$$

## Lemma

$p$ lies above $h \Leftrightarrow D(h)$ lies above $D(p)$.

## Theorem

Every $H$-polytope is a $V$-polytope. And the other way around.

### Proof

- ==Rest is omitted (30)==
- The other way around is by duality. ==Also omitted==

## Definition

**Face** of a convex polytope $P$ is

1.  $P$ itself
2.  $h \cap P$ where $h$ is a hyperplane such that $P$ is contained in one of the closed half-spaces determined by $h$.

## Observation

Every face of a polytope is a convex polytope.

## Definition

- $\dim(\emptyset) = -1$
- Face of dimension $d-1$ is called **facet**.
- Face of dimension $1$ is called **edge**.
- Face of dimension $0$ is called **vertex**.

## Definition

**Extermal point** $x$ of set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}: x \notin \text{conv}(X \setminus \{x\})$.

## Proposition

Let $P$ be a polytope.

1.  Extermal points of $P$ are exactly the vertices of $P$.
2.  $P$ is a convex hull of its vertices.
3.  “Face of a face is a face” - The vertices of a face $F$ of $P$ are exactly those vertices of $P$ that lie in $F$.

### Proof

==Omitted 34==

## Definition

**Graph** of a polytope $P$ denoted as $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ are vertices of $P$ and $E$ is the set of pairs vertices in the same edge of $P$.

## Observation

### Proof

*We project the polytope by a center to sufficiently large ball.*

$$
\Box
$$

## Baluskis’s theorem

The graph of a $d$-dimensional convex polytope is $d$-connected.

### *Without proof*

## Steinitz theorem

A finite graph isisomorphic to a graph of a $3$-dimensional polytope iff it is planar an $3$-connected.

### *Without proof*

## Euler’s formula

$$
|V| + F = |E| + 2
$$

For graph of $3$-dimensional polytopes. For plane drawings of connected planar graphs.

## Definition

**Face-lattice** of a convex polytope $P$ is $\mathcal{F}(P) :=$ set of all faces of $P$ $(\mathcal{F}(P), \subseteq)$.

- Convex polytopes are **combinatorially equivalent** if $(\mathcal{F}(P), \subseteq) \cong (\mathcal{F}(Q), \subseteq)$

### Properties (*No proofs*)

- $\forall F,G$ faces of $P : F \cap G$ is a face of $P$
- $\forall F,G$ faces of $P$ there exist $J \in \mathcal{F}(P)$ (**join** of $F$ and $G$) such that $F,G \subseteq J$ and if $F,G \subseteq H$ then $J \subseteq H$
- Every maximal chain in $(\mathcal{F}(P), \subseteq)$ has the same length $\dim(P) +2$ so they can be called **graded**.
- Every face is the join of its vertices.
- Every face is the intersection of all the facets containing it.

### Collary

The combinational type of a convex polytope is determined by its vertex-facets incidences.

## Definition

$P$ convex polytope containing the origin (in the interior). Then $P^{\ast}$ is the **dual polytope**.

### Proposition (*No proof*)

$(\mathcal{F}(P), \subseteq)$ is "$(\mathcal{F}(P), \subseteq)$ upside down". In particulary $j$-dimensional faces of $P^{\ast}$ correspond to $d-1-j$ dimensional faces of $P$.

### Remark

Let $P$ be a $3$-dimensional convex polytope with graph $G$ and then $P^{\ast}$ is dual polytope so $G^{\ast}$ is **dual graph of $G$**.

## Definition

A convex polytope $P$ is called **simplicial** if each of its facets is a simplex. (Then all $\leq d - 1$ dimensional faces are simplices.)

Then it is called **simple** if each of its vertices is contained in exactly $d$ facets.

## Observation

The dual of simplicial polytope is simple and vice versa.

## Definition

Let $P$ be a $d$-dimensional polytope and $f_{j} = f_{j}(P)$ is the number of $j$-faces of $P$. The vector $(f_{0}, f_{1}, \dots. f_{d})$ is the **$f$-vector** of $P$.

## Definition

- The curve $\gamma = \{(t,t^{2},t^{3}, \dots, t^{d}), t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is called the **moment curve**.
- The convex hull of a finite set of points on $\gamma$ is called a **cyclic polytope**.

## Lemma

Any hyperplane $h$ intersects $\gamma$ in at most $d$ points. If $| h \cap \gamma| = d$ then $h$ is not tangent.

### Proof

$$
h := \{x, \left< x, a \right> = b\} \dots a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2}+\dots, a \neq 0 \\
a_{d}x_{d} - b = 0

$$

- $x \in h \cap \gamma$
- $x = (t, t^{2}, t^{3}, \dots, t^{d})$
- ==Not complete==

## Corollary

Any finite subset of $\gamma$ is in general position. So the cyclic polytope is simplicial.

## Proposition *(Gale’s evenness criteria)*

Let $V$ be the set of vertices of a cyclic polytope, $V = \{v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n}\}$ numbered along $\gamma$ if $v_{i} = (t_{i}, t_{i}^{2}, t_{i}^{3}, \dots, t_{i}^{d})$. Then $t_{1} < t_{2} < \dots < t_{n}$. Let $W = \{v_{i1}, v_{i2}, \dots, v_{id}\} \subseteq V, i1 < i2 < \dots < id$. Then $W$ determines a facet iff $\forall v_{i}, v_{j} \subseteq V \setminus W$. The number of vertices $v_{ik}$ with $i < ik < j$ is **even**.

### Proof

- $h_{W}$ hyperplane and $h_{W} \cap P = \text{conv}(W)$
- $W$ determines a facet $\Leftrightarrow P$is in one half-space determined by $h_{W}$

## Theorem

The number of facets of a $d$-dimensional cyclic polytope with $n \geq d+1$ vertices is

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\binom{n - \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor} + \binom{n - \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor - 1}{\left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor - 1} & \text{for } d \text{ even} \\
2 \cdot \binom{n - \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor - 1}{\left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor} & \text{for } d \text{ odd}
\end{array}
\right.

$$

### Proof

If $d$ is even we have two possibilities either each couples are grouped or one is at the beginning and one at the end. First part is $d = 2k$ so $n-2k \cdot \binom{n-k}{k}$ and otherwise is $k-1$ which gives $n-2k \cdot \binom{n-k-1}{k-1}$. For odd number is similar. ==Not precise==

## The upper bound theorem

Among all $d$-dimensional convex polytopes with $n$ vertices, the cyclic polytope maximizes the number of faces of each dimension.

### *Without proof*

## Upper bound theorem, asymptotic version

A $d$-dimensional convex polytope with $n$ vertices has at most $2 \binom{n}{\lfloor \frac{d}{2}\rfloor}$ facets and at most $2^{d+1} \binom{n}{\lfloor \frac{d}{2}\rfloor}$ faces in total.

# ==Voronoi diagrams==

# Power diagrams

This is a generalization of Voronoi diagrams.

- $P$ set od points with weights or alternatively set of spheres $S_{i}$ with center $z_{i}$ and radius $r_{i}$.
- $x \in \text{reg}(S_{i})$ if $\text{pow}(x, S_{i}) \leq \text{pow}(x, S_{j})$ for $j \neq i$, where $\text{pow}(x, S_{i}) = (\text{dist}(x,z_{i}))^{2} - r_{i}^{2}$.
- Boundary between regions $S_{i}$ and $S_{j}$ is a hyperplane.

## Theorem

Power diagrams $\leftrightarrow$ projections of $d+1$ dimensional polyhedra $\leftrightarrow$ hyperplane section of Voronoi diagrams.

- For example power diagrams are used to prove *“Spicy chicken theorem”*.

# Arrangements

## Arrangements of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$

We have $\mathcal{H}$ set of hyperplanes. Then **cells** are components of $\mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus \bigcup \mathcal{H}$. **Faces** are relatively open components of $\bigcap \mathcal{H}' \setminus \bigcup (\mathcal{H} \setminus \mathcal{H}')$ for all $\mathcal{H}' \subseteq \mathcal{H}$. **Arrangement** is the set of all faces of all dimensions, formulating a partition of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. (*Face of dimension $1$ is called edge and of dimension $0$ is vertex.*)

- Every face is the interior of a convex polyhedron.
- Arrangement of $\mathcal{H} \sim$ dual of a finite point set.

### Number of cells

- In simple arrangements hyperplanes are in **general position** $: k \in \{1 , \dots, d+2\} \forall H_{1}, H_{2}, \dots , H_{k}$ $\bigcap_{i = 1}^{k} H_{i}$ is $d-k$ dimensional. If $|\mathcal{H}| \geq d + 1$ it is sufficient for $k = d$ and $k = d+1$.
- Combinational abstraction are oriented matroids.

#### Fact

Simple arrangements maximize the number of cells.

### Proposition

The number of cells in a simple arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is exactly

$$
\Phi_{d}(n) = \binom{n}{0} +\binom{n}{1} + \dots + \binom{n}{d}

$$

#### Proof

- Double inductions on both $n$ and $d$.
- In $d+1$ we have $n+1$ cells which is exactly $\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}$.
- If we have $d \geq 2$ and $n = 0$ is 1 cell (the whole space) and $1 = \binom{n}{0}$ also we can see for $n=1$ that $2 = \binom{1}{0} + \binom{1}{1} = 1 + 1$
- If we have $n \geq 1$ we have $n$ hyperplanes and we can remove one of them and then we get arrangement of $n-1$ hyperplanes denoted as $h_{n}$. So $\Phi_{d}(n-1)$ cells.
- $h_{n}$ splits $\Phi_{d-1}(n-1)$ cells in 2 parts so together

$$
\Phi_{d}(n) = \Phi_{d}(n-1) + \Phi_{d-1}(n-1) = 2 \binom{n-1}{0} +2 \binom{n-1}{1} + \dots + \binom{n-1}{d} =

$$

$$
= \binom{n-1}{0} +\left( \binom{n-1}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} \right) + \dots +\left( \binom{n-1}{d-1} + \binom{n-1}{d}\right) =
$$

$$
= \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \dots + \binom{n}{d}
$$

$$
\Box
$$

## Arrangements of other objects

- For example segments.
    - Complexity of $1$ cell. $\Theta(n \cdot \alpha(n))$, where $\alpha$ is inverse ackermann function.

## Arrangements of arbitrary sets

$A_{1}, \dots, A_{n} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ quite similar to venn diagrams.

- Equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that $x \sim y \Leftrightarrow (\forall i \in [n]) ( x \in A_{i} \leftrightarrow y \in A_{i})$.
- Equivalence classes $\forall I \subseteq [n] \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}, x \ in A_{i} \Leftrightarrow i \in I \} = \bigcap_{i \in I}A_{i} \setminus \bigcup_{i \neq j}A_{j}$.
- Face of the arrangement is connected component of an equivalence class.

## Arrangements of algebraic surfaces

$P_{1}, \dots P_{n} \in \mathbb{R}[x_{1}, \dots, x_{d}]$

- **Zero set** of $P_{i}$ denoted as $Z(P_{i}) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}, P_{i}(x) = 0\}$.
- Assume that $\deg P_{i} \leq D$ and degree is obtained by multiplying all degrees example $x^{15}y^{2}$ has degree $30$.

### Milnor theorem

If $D, d$ are constants, the maximum number of faces of the arrangements of $Z(P_{1}), Z(P_{2}), \dots, Z(P_{n})$ is $O(n^{d})$.

### Definition

A vector $\sigma = (\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \dots, \sigma_{n}) \in \{-1,0,1\}^{n}$ is called **sign pattern** of $P_{1}, \dots, P_{n}$ if there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that the sign of $P_{i}(x)$ is $\sigma_{i}$.

- Number of sign patterns is at most as the number of faces. Also is at most $3^n$.

### Theorem

$P_{1}, \dots, P_{n} \in \mathbb{R}[x_{1}, \dots, x_{d}]$ polynomials of maximum degree $D$, then the number of faces of the arrangements of $Z(P_{1}), Z(P_{2}), \dots , Z(P_{n})$ (and the number of the sign patterns) is at most $2 (2D)^{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d}2^{i}\binom{4n+1}{i}$ for $n \geq d \geq 2$ this is at most $\left(\frac{50 D n}{d}\right)^{d}$.

#### *Without proof*

## Arrangements of pseudolines

### Definition

A collection of pseudolines $p_{1}, \dots, p_{n}$ is if

1.  each $p_{i}$ is an two way unbounded simple curve
2.  $\forall i \neq j$ $p_{i}$ and $p_{j}$ cross exactly once (and $|p_{i} \cap p_{j}| = 1$)

Arrangement of pseudolines is **simple** if no $3$ cross at the same point.

## Levels in arrangements of hyperplanes

$H$ is set of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ none of them vertical.

### Definition

Level of vertex $x$ in $H$ is equal to the number of hyperplanes strictly underneath $x$.

### Clarkson’s level theorem

The number of vertices with level at most $k$ in arrangement $H$ is at most $O_{d}(n^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}(k+1)^{\lceil d/2 \rceil})$.

#### Note

It is asymptotically tight.

#### Proof

### Definition

**Zone** of hyperplane $g$ is set of faces of arrangement hyperplanes $H$, which “sees” a part of $G$.

### Zone theorem

$H$ is set of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $g$ is a hyperplane. The number of faces in zone $g$ of arrangements $H$ is at most $O(n^{d-1})$.
