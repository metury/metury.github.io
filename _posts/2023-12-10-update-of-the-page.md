Maybe someone stumbled upon my page more than once and may be confused about the change of appearance. That is because I have mooved from `just-the-docs` to `minima` for some reasons. Even though the `just-the-docs` is fairly nice and simple it has some drawbacks for me. In particular some of them are:

1. Minima has simple and easy `auto` mode for ligh/dark mode of the page.
2. It is minimal and yet very nicely done.
3. The deployment of the `just-the-docs` onto a GitHub pages resulted in some errors of finding the theme.

I hope this is a nice chaneg and hopefully it will be working flawlessly. See you later.
